### All The Things (att)

This is a program I'm writing mostly for my own usage. It is written in C and is based on the original [GNU Bash version](https://gist.github.com/echosa/390b968093c37e459ec38cd510d30de0) I wrote and use every day.

This project serves as a chance to dust off my C chops, which I've hardly used since college. If I get a personally useable program out of it, even better. If I get a program that others find useful, that'd be great as well.

Constructive criticism and tips for improvement are welcome. There's much about C I've forgotten, so I'm sure there are lots of things I can improve. Please share any improvements you find. Thanks!
